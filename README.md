Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images based on Deeplab-v3


data set:
The AI ​​classification and recognition of CCF satellite imagery. 


dataset
├── origin //5 remote sensing pictures with tags
├── test //3 remote sensing pictures, no tags, not used in this task
└── train // is empty, generated by random sampling in `python preprocess.py`
    ├── images
    └── labels

### dependency
cuda==8.0  
cudnn==6  
python==3.5     
pip install opencv-python==3.4.2.17    
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1  
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas	
	
Among them, we use the first four for training and the last one for testing


###Main strategy:
 Cut the original remote sensing image into picture blocks of size (256x256). The method of cropping is random sampling and data amplification
 Build a Deeplab-v3 model and use pre-trained resnet-v2-50 migration learning
 Complete training and testing program, using tensorboard to monitor model training
 Multi-scale splicing prediction, upgrade model
 Post-processing optimization, such as eliminating splicing traces of predicted pictures
 Use a better backbone network, such as Xception
 
| Method | mean-IoU | accuracy |
| :-----| :----: | :----: |
| baseline(deeplabv3) | 71.2 |-|
| resnet-v2-50 pretrain | 77.1 |-|
| Rotate four predictions and average | 77.6 | 85.5 |

### How to train
```
Download and store the dataset folder dataset in Baidu Cloud to the main directory of the project
python proprecess.py takes a little longer and needs to wait
python train.py takes a little longer, you can change how often args.test_display to view the test results
```  
 
###Final Results:
	The evaluation method is mean-IoU. In the case of very few data sets, the test set evaluation result gets a score of 77.3

### Method mean-IoU accuracy
	baseline(deeplabv3) 71.2-
	resnet-v2-50 pretrain 77.1-
	Rotate four predictions and average 77.6 85.5

### How to visualize the training process
```
cd to the home directory
tensorboard --logdir=./
```
